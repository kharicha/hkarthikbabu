'''
1,Given a list lst and a number N, create a new list
that contains each number of the list at most N times without reordering.
For example if N = 2, and the input is [1,2,3,1,2,1,2,3], you take [1,2,3,1,2], 
drop the next [1,2] since this would lead to 1 and 2 being in the result 3 times, and then take 3, 
which leads to [1,2,3,1,2,3]

# def arr(lst, n):
#     res = []
#     for a in lst:
#         if res.count(a) < n:
#             res.append(a)
#     print(res)
#
#
# arr([1,2,3,1,2,1,2,3], 2)
